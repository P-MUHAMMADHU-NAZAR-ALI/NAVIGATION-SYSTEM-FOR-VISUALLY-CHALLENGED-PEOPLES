# NAVIGATION-SYSTEM-FOR-VISUALLY-CHALLENGED-PEOPLES

## INTRODUCTION
 In a world dominated by visual cues and landmarks, those who are visually impaired face unique 
 challenges when it comes to navigating their surroundings. The simple act of walking down the 
 street, entering a building, or even finding their way in an unfamiliar place can be a daunting task. 
 But what if we could offer them a new perspective – a perspective from the ground up?
 Welcome to our groundbreaking project, "Navigating Blind People with Shoes." In this innovative 
initiative, we set out to redefine the way blind individuals interact with their environment by 
leveraging the very foundation of their mobility – their shoes.
