# NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR VISUALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLES

## üìò Introduction
In a world dominated by visual cues and landmarks, those who are visually impaired face unique challenges when it comes to navigating their surroundings. The simple act of walking down the street, entering a building, or even finding their way in an unfamiliar place can be a daunting task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components:
1. ARDUINO UNO
2. ULTRASONIC SENSOR
3. VIBRATION SENSOR
4. BUZZER
5. NEO 6M GPS MODULE
6. BREADBOARDS
7. HW BATTERY
8. JUMPER WIRES

## üéØ Objective:
To develop an IoT-based smart navigation system for visually impaired individuals that utilizes ultrasonic sensors, buzzers, a vibration sensor, and a GPS module to detect obstacles, provide directional feedback through unique sounds and vibrations, and enable real-time location tracking for enhanced mobility and safety.

## üîçProposed system:
Obstacle Detection and Feedback:
     The system uses four ultrasonic sensors, strategically placed in the user's shoes, to detect obstacles in four directions. Unique sound patterns from buzzers and vibrations provide clear and intuitive feedback to indicate the obstacle's location and proximity.
Tactile Navigation Assistance:
    A vibration sensor delivers tactile feedback to the user, with varying intensity based on the obstacle's distance. This ensures non-disruptive and precise navigation support for visually impaired individuals.
Location Tracking:
     The integrated GPS module tracks the user's real-time location, allowing caregivers or family members to monitor and assist if needed. This feature enhances the user's safety and offers peace of mind to their loved ones.

## üì∑Output:
1. Enhanced Navigation for Visually Impaired Individuals
2. Improved Awareness and Safety
3. Real-Time Location Monitoring**
4. Compact and Wearable Design
